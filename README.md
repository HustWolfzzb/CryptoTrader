# CryptoTrader


Here's a README template for DataHandler.py, which provides a clear overview of the configurations, functionalities, and instructions on how to run data handler:

---

## Configuration

Before running the scripts, configure the necessary credentials and parameters by creating a `Config.py` file in the root directory with the following contents:

```python
# Configuration for API access
ACCESS_KEY = 'your_access_key_here'
SECRET_KEY = 'your_secret_key_here'
PASSPHRASE = 'your_passphrase_here'

# Configuration for database connection
HOST_IP = 'database_host_ip'
HOST_USER = 'database_user'
HOST_PASSWD = 'database_password'

# Optional: Additional host if used
HOST_IP_1 = 'secondary_database_host_ip'
```

## Features

- **Data Handling**: Connects to a MySQL database to manage trading data.
- **Decimal Formatting**: Formats floating-point numbers in dataframes to specified decimal places.
- **Numeric Conversion**: Converts specified dataframe columns to numeric types, handling non-numeric data gracefully.
- **Database Operations**: Includes functionality to create tables, insert data, and remove duplicates to ensure data integrity.
- **Data Fetching**: Enhanced fetching capabilities to retrieve historical trading data based on flexible querying of time ranges.

## How to Run

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.6 or higher
- `mysql-connector-python`
- `pandas`
- `tqdm`

### Running the Application

1. **Setup the Database**: Ensure your MySQL database is running and accessible based on the credentials provided in `Config.py`.

2. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YourUsername/CryptoTrader.git
   cd CryptoTrader
   ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt  # Assuming you have a requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Execute the Main Script**:
   ```bash
   python main.py  # Assuming your main script is named main.py
   ```

   This will start the process of data fetching, processing, and populating your database with trading data.

## Modules Description

- `DataHandler`: Manages database connections and operations such as creating tables and inserting data.
- `format_decimal_places(df, decimal_places=1)`: Formats the decimal places of float columns in a dataframe.
- `convert_columns_to_numeric(df, columns=None)`: Converts columns in a dataframe to numeric types, useful for data processing before analysis.

### Note
Adjust the scripts according to your specific database schema and ensure that the required tables and columns are properly set up before running the scripts to avoid any runtime errors.

## Contribution

Contributions are welcome! Please fork the repository and submit pull requests to the main branch. For major changes, please open an issue first to discuss what you would like to change.
